            <p>This website use white space as well as coulors to attract you visually to the main attraction on the center of the page. The two colours converge on the middle where they want you to really fix your eyes on. You dont have to wonder what is important in this page because it is the first thing your eyes settle on.</p>

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>

            <p>This website doesnt really work well on mobile, it has the potential to be better. I think it uses Hick's law perfectly, it gives us two option to chose from which means it easier to find what you need, do you want male or female clothes? That just simplifies the shopping experience and takes away minutes off scrolling looking for one thing.</p>

            <img src="simplyChocolate.png" alt= "simply Chocolate website screenshot">
            <p>This website is so clean, it removed all the distractions from the page and you can just focus on the chocolate that they are advertising. it also use white space to keep you focused on the main event.</p>
